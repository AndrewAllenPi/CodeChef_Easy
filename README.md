My solutions to http://www.codechef.com easy problems

Hi there!

I hope this will be a useful resource for anyone attempting the code chef problems. My code style is (usually) a top-down approach with descriptive function names and  always breaking the problem down into chunks.  Being single one-off files that I won't likely use again I often don't leave the usual ammount of comments other than those I wrote at the same time as when I write the code in the first place. I don't normally concentate too much on optimisation other than using an efficient algorithm. 

If you are reading this and want more details on any of my solutions, feel free to email me on Andrewallen1.6180@yahoo.co.uk

If you are a potential employer, please email for a copy of my CV (though why you are here looking at easy problem solutions is beyond me)
